**Project: Insurance Claim Prediction**

## Introduction
This project aims to build a predictive model to assist the insurance marketing team in identifying customers likely to purchase a product and providing suggestions to increase customer engagement. The dataset contains information on various characteristics that influence insurance claim payments. The tasks include model development, comparison, and addressing challenges faced during the process.

### Tasks

#### Task 1: Create a Predictive Model
- **Objective:** Develop a model to predict customer likelihood of purchasing the insurance product.
- **Approach:** Employ machine learning algorithms to build predictive models based on the provided dataset.
- **Implementation:** Utilize the Jupyter notebook for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

#### Task 2: Suggestions to the Insurance Marketing Team
- **Objective:** Provide actionable suggestions to the marketing team to enhance customer engagement and increase product purchases.
- **Approach:** Analyze the model results and identify features influencing purchase decisions. Propose targeted strategies based on insights.
- **Implementation:** Use the Jupyter notebook to present findings and recommendations.

#### Model Comparison Report
- **Objective:** Evaluate the performance of multiple models on the dataset and recommend the best model for production.
- **Approach:** Train different machine learning models and compare their metrics to determine the most effective one.
- **Implementation:** Generate a comprehensive report within the Jupyter notebook summarizing the model comparison results.

#### Report on Challenges Faced
- **Objective:** Document challenges encountered during data exploration, preprocessing, and model development.
- **Approach:** Identify and explain challenges and describe the techniques employed to overcome them.
- **Implementation:** Document challenges and solutions in a report within the Jupyter notebook.
